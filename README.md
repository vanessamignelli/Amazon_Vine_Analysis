# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze Amazon reviews the were curated by members of the Amazon Vine program, and determine whether there is any bias towards favourable reviews from the paid Vine members. For this analysis, I used dataset containing reviews on toys. I then leverages PySpark to create an ETL process and connected it to an AWS RDS instance where the transformed data was finally loaded into pgAdmin. From there I leveraged Pandas in Python to decipher any biases present in the data set. 

## Results
